Bug Fixes:

- Fixed most minecraft libraries not being added to Knot's classpath (allowing them to be modified via mixin or overridden via mods)
    - This should fix lots of classloader compatibility issues with various mods.
    - (TODO list them!)
- Fixed server libraries not being identified properly with newer quilt-server-launcher.
- Fixed mod files being searched in preference to minecraft library files.
    - This fixes a bug with Valkyrien-Skies-2 stopping log messages.
- [#463] Fixed jar copied mods not being handled correctly in Java 8.
